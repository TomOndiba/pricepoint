<h2><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h2>

<p>
    PricePointDate is firmly committed to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.
</p>
<p>
    The protection of your privacy being very important, we have adopted the following practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What information do you gather automatically from visitors?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We use your IP address (the series of numbers associated with your individual computer) to help us maintain our site and identify problems with our server.
    Your IP address does not disclose any personally revealing information about you.
</p>
<p>
    We do use cookies to identify traffic that comes through advertising and to facilitate a more user friendly experience. Cookies are small pieces of
    information that a web site places on your computer's hard drive so we know it's you when you visit. This helps us to create a personalized experience for
    you when you visit our site. The use of cookies is a very common practice on the Internet.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What information will you ask me for?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you register to use any PricePointDate service you will be asked for some general information, which enables us to provide you with this
    individualized service. We gather contact information (like your email address), demographic information (like your city of residence or age). We may share
    some of this information for our own research purposes with our professional advisors or consultants and third party partners, however the information
    shared will be limited to non-personally identifying demographic information shared under cover of a confidentiality agreement. If you choose to buy
    credits, we collect financial information (like your credit card number and expiry date). We will ONLY use this information for billing. We do not disclose
    this information to any other party except to our payment processor.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have registered, you will be given the option of creating a pseudonymous profile (username and personal description). You will be asked for some
    personal but non-identifying information to complete your profile (i.e. whether you have children, height, body type, nationality, religion, whether you
    smoke, etc.). This information is not linked in any way to your personally identifiable information, for other members to see. Note that if you provide us
    with a photograph some of your information may become personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How will this information be used and who has access to it?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to have them sent to you, we may use your contact information to send you valuable updates and timely notices of promotions, updates, and
    status reports. Our site provides you with the opportunity to opt-in to receiving different types of communications from us at the point where we request
    registration information. You may modify this choice at any time by selecting "Settings" from the member home page. We reserve the right to use your
    contact information at any time to advise you of any updates that may materially affect your rights or status on our site.
</p>
<p>
    Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize your experience, allow other members to find you through a search, allow us
    to forward you further search results, to compose your personal profile—which is associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created—and to deliver
    targeted advertising and promotional offers to you from us and from external companies that are of the highest relevance to your demographic profile.
    PricePointDate promotional offers and service information maybe sent to your contact email from time to time as well as to your PricePointDate mailbox.
</p>
<p>
    The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never release your personally identifiable information to an
    external organization without your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts. We may disclose your
    personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law, which may include, but is not limited to a
    judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on PricePointDate.
</p>
<p>
    Although PricePointDate makes use of up-to-date technology in order to protect your pictures from being copied or captured by unauthorized third parties,
    please keep in mind that we cannot ensure complete protection. When we use your pictures in our service or our marketing materials we include the
    PricePointDate logo to serve as notice to third parties not to copy or use the pictures. The presence of this logo, or watermark does not in anyway imply
    copyright or other proprietary rights in and to the picture by PricePointDate and is merely provided to discourage the unauthorized use of the picture.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Do you monitor online behavior?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our members communicate with each other through onsite mail. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor members' private exchanges, we reserve the
    right to do so if we suspect users of being under 18 or of using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our terms of use or
    Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What security features do you have?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or
    order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet; it ensures that
    information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code
    until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination.
</p>
<p>
    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. If
    you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at the coordinates listed below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Advertisers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you inquire about advertising opportunities on our site, you will be asked for contact information and information related to your advertising
    objectives. This information will be used to provide you with the business information you are seeking. Your information is only shared with internal staff
    and the external ad representation agencies that sell media space on the site, on our behalf. PricePointDate sites may contain links to other sites not
    affiliated with PricePointDate. Please note that these other sites may have privacy policies that differ from those of PricePointDate. We have no control
    over any personal information that you provide to these sites.
</p>
<p>
    We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel
    gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely
    anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">click here</a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Associates</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you register to become an Associate of our site, you will be asked for contact information and information related to your site. Your information will
    only be used by internal staff and will never be shared with anyone external to the company other than our advisors and representatives without your
    consent, unless required to do so by operation of law. Your information will be used to secure your approval as an Associate, to facilitate communication
    between our two sites and to send you payment, based on your site's performance.
