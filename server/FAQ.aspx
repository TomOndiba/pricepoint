<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>The first date went well. Can I get paid for additional dates with the same Gentleman? </strong>

    does not pay you for the date or only pays you a portion of what is due, he may be held accountable. You can take your complaint to the small claims court.
    Make sure you save receipts, communication and any other evidence that you went on the first date as scheduled. Although we are not responsible for
    agreements made between our members, these agreements are binding and the documentation may be used in court.
